Person 1: Dude, have you heard what the king is said to have done?
Person 2: Yeah. Everyone is talking about it now! I can't believe king did this to the Elves!
After these words, I decided to come closer to hear better.
Person 1: They say, he has already expelled 7 innocent Elven families from the Kingdom.
WHAT?! King expells Elves from the kingdom?
B-but why? King Cyril was known for his tolerance to other races.
Relax Evie. It's just giibberish, it's definitely not true.
???: Evie! Your shift's finished, leave your apron in the back and you can go home.
I looked at the clock
7:30 PM already? When did it flew by?
Evie: O-ok, I'm going.
???: Did something happen? You look pale. Do you want me to walk you home?
Evie: No Ida, everything's fine.
Ida: Ok, just be careful.
Evie: Ok, mooom.
I smiled under my breath.
Ida is my 5 years older friend from work. Since I came here she is very caring for me.
Still pale, I left the bar. I decided to go to the forest. I need to cool down and think about what i found out.
